# In the World

Find me here --> https://www.in-the-world.web.app

## Motivation

Have you heard that China is, for the first time in a long time, worried about a declining birth rate? Did you know about the massive uprisings in Belarusia in protest of an authoritarian dictatorship? How about the slaughter of countless civilians in the continuing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia?

It can be quite difficult to keep up with current events simply because we aren't made aware of what's going on in other parts of the world, unless we thoroughly investigate on our own. Of course, doing so would require digging through countless news sources for each place of interest. Imagine how long that would take, just to have to do it all over again the next day.

Although news sources abound, there is no centralized resource to get a broad or brief understanding of what's going on in each part of the world all at once. That's where **In the World** comes in.

## What am I?

**In the World** attempts to democratize knowledge of current events by reducing the barrier to entry. It's kind of the 2021 equivalent of collecting a bunch of news papers from around the world, cutting out the most relevant articles, and sorting them for you at the blink of an eye.

**In the World** allows you to ask the whole world the same question at once, and discover each country's answer at the click of a button. Results are links, so you can simply click them to read more.

By default, **In the World** asks "what's going on in the world?" But fret not! If you're curious about something else, just change the question in the red text box and ask away!
